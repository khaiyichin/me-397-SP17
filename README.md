ME 397 SP 17 Project Course

This repo is from a self created project course when I was doing my master's degree at UT Austin, which provides the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm solution to the Oliver30 travelling salesman problem. More information on the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm can be found here: [Ant System](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2225338), [Ant Colony Optimization](http://www.aco-metaheuristic.org/).
